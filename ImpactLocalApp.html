     <h3> Project Overview </h3>
       <h4>Roles: </h4>
       <p>  UX Designer & Research Lead</p>
       <h4>Timeline: </h4>
       <p>  12 weeks</p>
       <h4>Tools: </h4>
       <p>  Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Tablet, Pen & Paper</p>
     <h4>Summary: </h4>
     <p>  Many young people new to engaging with their communities often felt overwhelmed and unsure where to begin to make sure their voices were heard. To change that, I led the UX design of ImpactLocal, a mobile app designed to empower young people with clear, accessible information about community events and political opportunities. This case study explores how a foundation of empathy and looking beyond frustration helped to reveal a deeper need—resources that help young people take control of their own future. The resulting design values trust, simplicity, and accessibility to help young people gain the confidence they need to step forward and engage with the community in the ways that truly matter to them.</p>
     
     <h3> Problem Statement </h3>
       <p> Users found it challenging to balance their daily responsibilities with becoming involved with their local community. To support them, the mobile app had to provide one clear place for planning and accessing needed information to make it easier for users to decide how, when, and where they want to engage with others. The app is a tool designed to help support young people in confidently making their own choices and expressing their opinions in a meaningful way.</p>
       <p><strong>Goals:</strong> 1. Create a Centralized Information Platform 2. Empower Users to Make Their Own Decisions 3. Accessibility</p>
     
       <h3> Design Process</h3>
         <h4> Empathize</h4>
           <p> I conducted user research with four participants, aged 18 to 25, and used their perspectives to inform empathy maps and personas that captured the challenges and priorities that shaped their daily lives. By attentively listening to what participants shared and observing nonverbal cues such as body language, I uncovered meaningful pain points with existing tools designed to foster civic engagement among young people. Initially, I assumed that involvement in local politics—particularly voting—would be a minor focus for most participants. However, the research revealed a more nuanced reality: while community and political engagement often takes a backseat for young people, it holds deep significance for others with issues that align with their values.  </p>
           <div class="image-container">
             <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/persona1-impact.png" style=justify-content:center alt="persona card" class="side-images">
           </div>
           <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Many participants expressed that meeting basic personal and life needs often takes precedence; meaning civic participation tends to follow when causes feel directly relevant and impactful. Building on these findings, I created user journey maps for each persona to visualize their motivations, behaviors, and emotional responses when interacting with tools aimed at increasing community and political involvement. </p>
         
         <h4> Define</h4>
           <p>Many young people--whether students, professionals, or caregivers—face the challenge of balancing everyday responsibilities and personal well-being while also trying to learn about and engage with their communities. They need accessible tools that make it easier to stay informed about local events, voting opportunities, and political issues without adding extra stress, so they can focus on their lives while participating meaningfully when it matters to them.</p>

         <h4> Ideate</h4>
         <div class="image-container">
            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/impactlowfimobile1.png" alt="mobile wireframe home page" class="side-images">
            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/impactlowfimobile2.png" alt="mobile wireframe representatives page" class="side-images">
            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/impactlowfimobile3.png" alt="mobile wireframe need to register to vote page" class="side-images">
            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/impactlowfimobile4.png" alt="mobile wireframe choose location page" class="side-images">
          </div>

           <p>For ImpactLocal, I prioritized consistency, neutral language, and accessibility in the design:</p>
             <ul>
               <li><strong>Color:</strong> A simple, cohesive palette of black, green, and yellow were chosen to ensure	consistency with ImpactLocal’s brand identity across all screens, ensuring a clear and	recognizable visual language. </li>
               <li><strong>Language Choices:</strong> The wording used for explanations and buttons was intentionally written in neutral and inclusive language, aimed to appeal to a broad audience and	avoids unintentionally triggering emotional responses, which is particularly important given the polarizing nature of politics.</li>
               <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> ImpactLocal offers customizable settings, including high-contrast mode, larger text options, and enlarged buttons to accommodate different user needs. Additionally, care was taken to cross-reference with WCAG accessibility guidelines with the major design decisions and to foster a more equitable user-friendly experience for all.</li>
               </ul>

         <h4> Prototype</h4>
           <p>Check out the low-fidelity prototype here:</p>
           <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/tR7wBGOkQNMhrvjz0zh3Rt/ImpactLocal?node-id=1-9&p=f&t=dbWinlNMwTq7Bf3a-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=1%3A2&starting-point-node-id=1%3A9">Mobile</a> 
           
           <div class="image-container">
             <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/impactmockupmobile1.png" alt="mobile mockup petition page (high contrast)" class="side-images">
             <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/impactmockupmobile2.png" alt="mobile mockup local representative Matt Benjamin page" class="side-images">

           </div>

           <p>The prototype was iteratively refined throughout usability testing sessions, with participant feedback guiding improvements in accessibility and minimizing friction around common pain points. After each session, key issues were addressed promptly to ensure the design evolved in direct response to user needs.</p>
           <h4>Key Issues and Fixes:</h4>
             <ul>
               <li><strong>Test Menu Bar Icons:</strong> The low-fidelity design had placeholder icons that were not descriptive enough to the function of the icon and this was fixed by utilizing Google’s Material Design library to match the Android mobile prototype template chosen and utilizing icons for common and clear purpose. The icons used were the universally accepted accessibility menu icon and location icon in addition to a back arrow and hamburger menu.</li>
               <li><strong>Homepage Features Adjusted:</strong> The homepage was initially just the top main features, the events carousel, local initiatives, and the election countdown. There was another feature that this was determined to be needed by users, a way to get to the representatives’ page (other than the hamburger menu). A button to take users directly to the representatives’ page was added to the main page to fix the issue.</li>
             </ul>

         <h4> Test</h4>
           <p> I ran unmoderated usability tests with 6 people each time to gain user feedback and insight into the designs to iterate through the design process to improve upon the current designs.</p> 
           <h5>Big Takeaways From Testing:</h5>
             <ul>
               <li>Users were generally moderately satisfied with the functionality and usability of the app.</li>
               <li>Having others review important features and animations is important to make sure designs are fluid and functional for testing.
             </li>
             <li>While it’s unlikely that every user will be fully satisfied with the design, it’s essential to prioritize common feedback to guide future improvements that can be expanded to meet the basic needs of all users.<li> 
             </ul>

     <h3>Impact</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Users were generally somewhat satisfied with the current functionality of the app with 80% of users giving a 3/5 for satisfaction when using the app. The usability of the app was generally considered good with 70% of users selecting 4/5 when using the app.</li> 
         <li>User Quotes:</li>
         <ul>
           <li>"The pages are easy to find and read.” - Study Participant A</li>
           <li>"I like that it’s not hidden!” (when talking about the accessibility menu) – Study Participant B</li>
         </ul>
       </ul>
     
     <h3> Takeaways & Next Steps</h3>
       <h4>Takeaways</h4>
         <p>This project reminded me that UX can be challenging to balance out different perspectives and user needs. By leading with empathy, I was able to design solutions that were useful and not completely novel which helped to respond to a range of users’ needs and wants in an app to get young people involved in politics.</p>
         <p>Looking back, I would have prioritized involving more users overall earlier in the design process. With the resource limitations, I made the best of what I had, but there is room for improvement in incorporating a more diverse range of users in terms of ability level, race, gender, and so on and so forth. The users’ feedback during testing offered valuable insights into accessibility considerations and what made sense to include for younger people in an app designed for them. It helped me see the product from different perspectives. Including more people from the beginning would have led to an even more inclusive and impactful design.</p>

       <h4>Next Steps</h4>
         <ul>
           <li><strong>Expand Accessibility Options: </strong> Enhance the settings page with overlays (i.e. tab order, annotations, etc.) to allow for further customization, ensuring a more inclusive experience for users with diverse ranges of needs. </li>
           <li><strong>Add a Bias Checker: </strong>This is in effort to improve critical thinking options about information presented and give users the option to see that different news sources report on similar things, just differently. 
        </li>
           <li><strong>Streamlined Developer Handoff: </strong>Label design components more clearly and create annotations that align with common development frameworks, making the implementation process more efficient and less prone to errors due to lack of communication for developers.
            </li>
         </ul>
