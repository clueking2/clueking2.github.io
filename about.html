		<h2> <u>My Philosophy</u> </h2>
			<div class="value-header">
			<h3> Be Authentic </h3>
			</div>
			<div class="value-section">	
				<p> Authenticity is essential in every aspect of design.</p>
				<p> This principle guides the decision-making process at each stage, ensuring that design choices align with values and vision. </p>
				<p>Not every design will resonate with everyone, so it is crucial to stay focused on what truly matters, being genuine. </p>
			</div>	
			
			<div class="value-header">
			<h3> Be Curious </h3>
			</div>
			<div class="value-section">	
				<p> Curiosity is a key asset.</p>
				<p> It fosters creative thinking when approaching problems and seeking solutions. </p>
				<p>This helps to enable the exploration of a broader range of possibilities to effectively address design challenges.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="value-header">
				<h3> Be Empathetic </h3>
			</div>
			<div class="value-section">
				<p> Empathy is the foundation of meaninful connections.</p> 
				<p> By truly listening to others we create a space where collaboration feels safe and ideas can grow. </p>
				<p>Without empathy, trust fades, leaving users and designers without the tools they need to create impactful experiences together.</p>
